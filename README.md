# lox-one

This is simple tree-walking interpreter for the Lox language.

This repo implements the jlox interpreter from the great [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by the awesome [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent).

## Progress

- [*] Scanner
- [*] Parser
- [*] Environment
- [*] Variables
- [*] Conditionals `if/else`
- [*] Loops (`for` and `while` loops)
- [*] Functions (first-class, closures)
- [] Resolver
- [] Classes
- [] Inheritance

## Later Ideas

I think if I can get done with the book I will add:

- [] Lists
- [] Hashmaps
- [] Operator Overloading
- [] TypeScript style type-checking
