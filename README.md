# lox-one

This is simple tree-walking interpreter for the Lox language.

This repo implements the jlox interpreter from the great [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by the awesome [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent).

## Progress

- [x] Scanner
- [x] Parser
- [x] Environment
- [x] Variables
- [x] Conditionals `if/else`
- [x] Loops (`for` and `while` loops)
- [x] Functions (first-class, closures)
- [x] Resolver
- [] Classes
- [] Inheritance

## Later Ideas

I think if I can get done with the book I will add:

- [] Lists
- [] Hashmaps
- [] Operator Overloading
- [] TypeScript style type-checking
